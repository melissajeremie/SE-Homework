      <h2>Hello, world.</h2>
      <br>
        <p>Hi, everyone. I'm Melissa. I'm originally from the Caribbean but I moved to New York in the 3rd grade. Since then, I have lived in both  The Bronx and Brooklyn. I love hanging out with friends in the city, so I'm always taking pictures, a few of which you'll see on this site. </p>

        <p>I love my city, even though living here hasn't always been easy. And while I am thinking of moving away eventually, NYC will always have my heart. Here's the theme song to one of my very favorite NYC shows, Sex &amp The City. Every time I hear it, I can't help but feel nostalgic and think back on all the memories I've made here!</p>
